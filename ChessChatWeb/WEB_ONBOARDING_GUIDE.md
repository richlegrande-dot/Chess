# ChessChat Web - Getting Started Guide

Welcome to **ChessChat**, where you play chess against AI and then discuss your game strategy!

## 🎮 How to Play

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Opponent

When you first open ChessChat, you'll see three options:
- **Play Chess vs AI** - Start a new game
- **Settings** - Adjust preferences (coming soon)
- **About** - Learn more about ChessChat

Click **Play Chess vs AI** to begin.

### Step 2: Select Your AI Model

You'll be presented with different AI opponents. We recommend starting with **GPT-4o Mini** (marked as "Recommended"):
- **GPT-4o Mini**: Balanced and fast, perfect for learning chess basics
- **GPT-4o**: Stronger reasoning but slower response times
- **o1-mini**: Advanced tactical thinking with longer wait times

Don't worry about picking the "wrong" one - you can try different models after each game!

### Step 3: Play Your Game

1. **Make your move**: Click on a piece to see its legal moves (highlighted squares), then click where you want to move it
2. **Watch for indicators**: 
   - "▶️ Your turn" means it's time for you to move
   - "⏳ AI's turn" with a spinner means the AI is thinking
3. **Stay patient**: Some AI models take 5-15 seconds to think about their move
4. **Use the buttons**:
   - **Resign** - Give up the current game
   - **New Game** - Start fresh (current game is abandoned)

### Step 4: Review Your Game

When the game ends (checkmate, stalemate, or draw), you'll see a **Game Summary** with:
- **Outcome**: Victory, Defeat, or Draw
- **Moves Made**: Total number of moves in the game
- **Opening Played**: The chess opening that was used (e.g., "King's Pawn Opening")
- **Estimated Blunders**: Approximate count of major mistakes
- **Pieces Captured**: How many pieces were taken

### Step 5: Get AI Analysis (Optional)

Click **Analyze with AI** to discuss the game:
- Ask about specific moves: "Why did you play Knight to f6?"
- Learn strategy: "What was my biggest mistake?"
- Understand patterns: "How could I have defended better?"

Or click **Play Again** to jump straight into a new game!

## 💡 Tips for New Players

### Understanding Error Messages
- **"That move isn't allowed"**: You tried an illegal chess move. Try a different piece or destination.
- **"Network issue"**: Check your internet connection and try again.
- **"Too many games right now"**: The AI service is busy. Wait 10-20 seconds and try again.
- **"The AI took too long"**: The AI didn't respond in time. Click "New Game" or try a different model.

### Game Rules Reminders
- **Check**: When the king is under attack, you must move it to safety
- **Checkmate**: When the king has no legal moves and is under attack, the game ends
- **Stalemate**: If you have no legal moves but aren't in check, it's a draw
- **Castling**: You can castle if neither king nor rook has moved, and there are no pieces between them
- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture that can happen after an opponent's pawn moves two squares

### Making the Most of ChessChat
1. **Try different AI models**: Each one plays slightly differently
2. **Use the chat analysis**: The AI can explain chess concepts you don't understand
3. **Review your blunders**: The game summary shows where you likely made mistakes
4. **Play multiple games**: The more you play, the more patterns you'll recognize

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- Your games are **not stored permanently** - they exist only during your browser session
- Game analysis happens through OpenAI's API with standard privacy policies
- No personal information is collected or tracked
- Your chess moves and chat messages are sent to AI models for processing

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### The AI isn't responding
- Wait 15-20 seconds - some models are slow
- Check your internet connection
- Try clicking "New Game" and selecting a different AI model
- If errors persist, refresh the page

### My piece won't move
- Make sure it's your turn (look for "▶️ Your turn")
- Verify the move is legal in chess rules
- Try clicking the piece again to deselect it, then re-select

### The game ended unexpectedly
- Check the game summary for the outcome (checkmate, stalemate, draw)
- If the king is in check with no legal moves, that's checkmate
- If you have no legal moves but aren't in check, that's stalemate (draw)

### I want to undo a move
- Currently, there's no undo feature - this encourages thinking before moving
- You can always start a new game with the "New Game" button

## 📚 Learning Resources

ChessChat is designed to help you learn, but here are some terms you might hear in chat analysis:

- **Opening**: The first 10-15 moves that establish your position
- **Middle game**: The strategic phase after pieces are developed
- **Endgame**: The final phase with fewer pieces on the board
- **Tactics**: Short-term combinations like forks, pins, skewers
- **Strategy**: Long-term plans like controlling the center or attacking a weakness
