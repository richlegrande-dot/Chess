## Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5)

**Key Ideas:**
- Fight for the d4 square

- **Classical (5...Nc6)**: Solid development, aims for ...d5 break

**Typical Plan for Black:**
1. Develop pieces rapidly
2. Create queenside counterplay
3. Avoid premature central breaks
4. Time the ...d5 advance carefully

## French Defense (1.e4 e6)

A solid, strategic opening where Black accepts a slightly cramped position in exchange for a rock-solid pawn structure and counterplay on the queenside.

**Key Ideas:**
- Build a strong pawn chain
- Attack White's pawn center with ...c5 or ...f6
